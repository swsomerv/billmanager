To install locally:

1. Download and install Apache, MySQL, and PHP. [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) is good for Windows.
2. Create a database and run /scripts/db.sql on it.
3. Modify /application/config/database.sample.php with the appropriate values for connecting to the database.
4. Rename database.sample.php to database.php.
5. Add some users to the users table.
6. It should now be working.
